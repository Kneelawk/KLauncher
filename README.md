KLauncher
=======

KLauncher is a custom, MultiMC-based launcher for Minecraft.

### KLauncher is a Fork
KLauncher is a fork of MultiMC. As such, issues with KLauncher should **not** be brought to MultiMC developers unless the issue **also** appears in MultiMC, in which case the issue should be brought irrespective of KLauncher and KLauncher should not be mentioned in the issue.

### Building
If you want to build the launcher yourself, check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

## Forking/Redistributing/Custom builds policy
KLauncher is a fork of MultiMC and is open-source under the Apache license, just like MultiMC.

Like with MultiMC, the license gives you access to the source KLauncher is build from, but:
- Not the name, logo and other branding.
- Not the API tokens required to talk to services the launcher depends on.

Because of the nature of the agreements required to interact with the Microsoft identity platform, it's impossible for me to allow people to build the code as 'KLauncher'. The source code has been debranded and now builds as `DevLauncher` by default.

You must provide your own branding if you want to distribute your own builds.

You will also have to register your own app on Azure to be able to handle Microsoft account logins.
